	Abstract = {We describe a fully automated method for model-based tissue classification of magnetic resonance (MR) images of the brain. The method interleaves classification with estimation of the model parameters, improving the classification at each iteration. The algorithm is able to segment single- and multispectral MR images, corrects for MR signal inhomogeneities, and incorporates contextual information by means of Markov random Fields (MRF's). A digital brain atlas containing prior expectations about the spatial location of tissue classes is used to initialize the algorithm. This makes the method fully automated and therefore it provides objective and reproducible segmentations. We have validated the technique on simulated as well as on real MR images of the brain.},

@article{Wells:1996aa,
	Abstract = {Intensity-based classification of MR images has proven problematic, even when advanced techniques are used. Intrascan and interscan intensity inhomogeneities are a common source of difficulty. While reported methods have had some success in correcting intrascan inhomogeneities, such methods require supervision for the individual scan. This paper describes a new method called adaptive segmentation that uses knowledge of tissue intensity properties and intensity inhomogeneities to correct and segment MR images. Use of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm leads to a method that allows for more accurate segmentation of tissue types as well as better visualization of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, that has proven to be effective in a study that includes more than 1000 brain scans. Implementation and results are described for segmenting the brain in the following types of images: axial (dual-echo spin-echo), coronal [three dimensional Fourier transform (3-DFT) gradient-echo T1-weighted] all using a conventional head coil, and a sagittal section acquired using a surface coil. The accuracy of adaptive segmentation was found to be comparable with manual segmentation, and closer to manual segmentation than supervised multivariant classification while segmenting gray and white matter.},

By means of Markov random fields (MRF's) the segmentation algorithm captures three features that are of special importance for MR images, i.e., nonparametric distributions of tissue intensities, neighborhood correlations, and signal inhomogeneities. Detailed simulations and real MR images demonstrate the performance of the segmentation algorithm. In particular, the impact of noise, inhomogeneity, smoothing, and structure thickness are analyzed quantitatively. Even single-echo MR images are well classified into gray matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, scalp-bone, and background. A simulated annealing and an iterated conditional modes implementation are presented.},

@article{Geman:1984aa,
	Abstract = {We make an analogy between images and statistical mechanics systems. Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

Patients with normal head anatomy and with abnormalities such as multiple sclerosis lesions and brain tumors were scanned with a 1.5 T MR system using a two echo contiguous (interleaved), multislice pulse sequence that provides both proton density and T2-weighted contrast. After the user identified the tissues, the 3D data were automatically segmented into background, facial tissue, brain matter, CSF, and lesions. Surfaces of the face, brain, lateral ventricles, tumors, and multiple sclerosis lesions are displayed using color coding and gradient shading. Color improves the visualization of segmented tissues, while gradient shading enhances the perception of depth. Manipulation of the 3D model on a workstation aids surgical planning. Sulci and gyri stand out, thus aiding functional mapping of the brain surface.},

	Abstract = {A computerized system for processing spin-echo magnetic resonance (MR) imaging data was implemented to estimate whole brain (gray and white matter) and cerebrospinal fluid volumes and to display three-dimensional surface reconstructions of specified tissue classes. The techniques were evaluated by assessing the radiometric variability of MR volume data and by comparing automated and manual procedures for measuring tissue volumes. Results showed (a) the homogeneity of the MR data and (b) that automated techniques were consistently superior to manual techniques. Both techniques, however, were affected by the complexity of the structure, with simpler structures (eg, the intracranial cavity) showing less variability and better spatial correlation of segmentation results between raters. Moreover, the automated techniques were completed for whole brain in a fraction of the time required to complete the equivalent segmentation manually. Additional evaluations included interrater reliability and an evaluation that included longitudinal measurement, in which one subject was imaged sequentially 24 times, with reliability computed from data collected by three raters over 1 year. Results showed good reliability for the automated segmentation procedures.},

@article{Zhang:2001aa,
	Abstract = {The finite mixture (FM) model is the most commonly used model for statistical segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images because of its simple mathematical form and the piecewise constant nature of ideal brain MR images. However, being a histogram-based model, the FM has an intrinsic limitation--no spatial information is taken into account. This causes the FM model to work only on well-defined images with low levels of noise; unfortunately, this is often not the the case due to artifacts such as partial volume effect and bias field distortion. Under these conditions, FM model-based methods produce unreliable results. In this paper, we propose a novel hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model, which is a stochastic process generated by a MRF whose state sequence cannot be observed directly but which can be indirectly estimated through observations. Mathematically, it can be shown that the FM model is a degenerate version of the HMRF model. The advantage of the HMRF model derives from the way in which the spatial information is encoded through the mutual influences of neighboring sites. Although MRF modeling has been employed in MR image segmentation by other researchers, most reported methods are limited to using MRF as a general prior in an FM model-based approach. To fit the HMRF model, an EM algorithm is used. We show that by incorporating both the HMRF model and the EM algorithm into a HMRF-EM framework, an accurate and robust segmentation can be achieved. More importantly, the HMRF-EM framework can easily be combined with other techniques. As an example, we show how the bias field correction algorithm of Guillemaud and Brady (1997) can be incorporated into this framework to achieve a three-dimensional fully automated approach for brain MR image segmentation.},

@article{Ribes:2014aa,
	Abstract = {An algorithm dedicated to automatic segmentation of breast magnetic resonance images is presented in this paper. Our approach is based on a pipeline that includes a denoising step and statistical segmentation. The noise removal preprocessing relies on an anisotropic diffusion scheme, whereas the statistical segmentation is conducted through a Markov random field model. The continuous updating of all parameters governing the diffusion process enables automatic denoising, and the partial volume effect is also addressed during the labeling step. To assess the relevance, the Jaccard similarity coefficient was computed. Experiments were conducted on synthetic data and breast magnetic resonance images extracted from a high-risk population. The relevance of the approach for the dataset is highlighted, and we demonstrate accuracy superior to that of traditional clustering algorithms. The results emphasize the benefits of both denoising guided by input data and the inclusion of spatial dependency through a Markov random field. For example, the Jaccard coefficient for the clinical data was increased by 114%, 109%, and 140% with respect to a K-means algorithm and, respectively, for the adipose, glandular and muscle and skin components. Moreover, the agreement between the manual segmentations provided by an experienced radiologist and the automatic segmentations performed with this algorithm was good, with Jaccard coefficients equal to 0.769, 0.756, and 0.694 for the above-mentioned classes.},

@article{Gubern-Merida:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Breast density measurement is an important aspect in breast cancer diagnosis as dense tissue has been related to the risk of breast cancer development. The purpose of this study is to develop a method to automatically compute breast density in breast MRI. The framework is a combination of image processing techniques to segment breast and fibroglandular tissue. Intra- and interpatient signal intensity variability is initially corrected. The breast is segmented by automatically detecting body-breast and air-breast surfaces. Subsequently, fibroglandular tissue is segmented in the breast area using expectation-maximization. A dataset of 50 cases with manual segmentations was used for evaluation. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), total overlap, false negative fraction (FNF), and false positive fraction (FPF) are used to report similarity between automatic and manual segmentations. For breast segmentation, the proposed approach obtained DSC, total overlap, FNF, and FPF values of 0.94, 0.96, 0.04, and 0.07, respectively. For fibroglandular tissue segmentation, we obtained DSC, total overlap, FNF, and FPF values of 0.80, 0.85, 0.15, and 0.22, respectively. The method is relevant for researchers investigating breast density as a risk factor for breast cancer and all the described steps can be also applied in computer aided diagnosis systems.},

@article{Tustison:2011aa,
	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop an automated segmentation method to differentiate the ventilated lung volume on (3) He magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Computational processing (CP) for each subject consisted of the following three essential steps: 1) inhomogeneity bias correction, 2) whole lung segmentation, and 3) subdivision of the lung segmentation into regions of similar ventilation. Evaluation consisted of two comparative analyses: i) comparison of the number of defects scored by two human readers in 43 subjects, and ii) simultaneous truth and performance level estimation (STAPLE) in 18 subjects in which the ventilation defects were manually segmented by four human readers.
RESULTS: There was excellent correlation between the number of ventilation defects tabulated by CP and reader #1 (intraclass correlation coefficient [ICC] = 0.86), CP and reader #2 (ICC = 0.85), and between the two readers (ICC = 0.97). The STAPLE results from the second analysis yielded the following sensitivity/specificity numbers: CP (0.898/0.905), radiologist #1 (0.743/0.897), radiologist #2 (0.501/0.985), radiologist #3 (0.898/0.848), and the first author (0.600/0.984).
CONCLUSION: We developed and evaluated an automated method for quantifying the ventilated lung volume on (3) He MRI. The findings strongly indicate that our proposed algorithmic processing may be a reliable, automatic method for quantitating ventilation defects.},

Multispectral techniques originally developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for satellite image analysis were used in sequence selection, image data correction, image standardization, and image interpretation. Numerous sequence combinations with varying repetition times (TR) and echo times (TE) were considered, and a triplet was selected consisting of long TR/long TE, short TR/short TE, and an opposed phase sequence with intermediate TR and TE. Correction to remove system-imposed intensity inhomogeneities was required for all images. Image standardization based on fat and pectoral muscle signals was necessary for intercase comparisons. Multispectral images obtained based on this analysis suggest the feasibility of intensity-based image classification.},

	Abstract = {Image restoration is an important and widely studied problem in computer vision and image processing. Various image filtering strategies have been effective, but invariably make strong assumptions about the properties of the signal and/or degradation. Hence, these methods lack the generality to be easily applied to new applications or diverse image collections. This paper describes a novel unsupervised, information-theoretic, adaptive filter (UINTA) that improves the predictability of pixel intensities from their neighborhoods by decreasing their joint entropy. In this way, UINTA automatically discovers the statistical properties of the signal and can thereby restore a wide spectrum of images. The paper describes the formulation to minimize the joint entropy measure and presents several important practical considerations in estimating neighborhood statistics. It presents a series of results on both real and synthetic data along with comparisons with current state-of-the-art techniques, including novel applications to medical image processing.},

	Abstract = {Many studies of the human brain have explored the relationship between cortical thickness and cognition, phenotype, or disease. Due to the subjectivity and time requirements in manual measurement of cortical thickness, scientists have relied on robust software tools for automation which facilitate the testing and refinement of neuroscientific hypotheses. The most widely used tool for cortical thickness studies is the publicly available, surface-based FreeSurfer package. Critical to the adoption of such tools is a demonstration of their reproducibility, validity, and the documentation of specific implementations that are robust across large, diverse imaging datasets. To this end, we have developed the automated, volume-based Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs) cortical thickness pipeline comprising well-vetted components such as SyGN (multivariate template construction), SyN (image registration), N4 (bias correction), Atropos (n-tissue segmentation), and DiReCT (cortical thickness estimation). In this work, we have conducted the largest evaluation of automated cortical thickness measures in publicly available data, comparing FreeSurfer and ANTs measures computed on 1205 images from four open data sets (IXI, MMRR, NKI, and OASIS), with parcellation based on the recently proposed Desikan-Killiany-Tourville (DKT) cortical labeling protocol. We found good scan-rescan repeatability with both FreeSurfer and ANTs measures. Given that such assessments of precision do not necessarily reflect accuracy or an ability to make statistical inferences, we further tested the neurobiological validity of these approaches by evaluating thickness-based prediction of age and gender. ANTs is shown to have a higher predictive performance than FreeSurfer for both of these measures. In promotion of open science, we make all of our scripts, data, and results publicly available which complements the use of open image data sets and the open source availability of the proposed ANTs cortical thickness pipeline.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To adapt the so-called nonlocal means filter to deal with magnetic resonance (MR) images with spatially varying noise levels (for both Gaussian and Rician distributed noise).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Most filtering techniques assume an equal noise distribution across the image. When this assumption is not met, the resulting filtering becomes suboptimal. This is the case of MR images with spatially varying noise levels, such as those obtained by parallel imaging (sensitivity-encoded), intensity inhomogeneity-corrected images, or surface coil-based acquisitions. We propose a new method where information regarding the local image noise level is used to adjust the amount of denoising strength of the filter. Such information is automatically obtained from the images using a new local noise estimation method.
RESULTS: The proposed method was validated and compared with the standard nonlocal means filter on simulated and real MRI data showing an improved performance in all cases.
CONCLUSION: The new noise-adaptive method was demonstrated to outperform the standard filter when spatially varying noise is present in the images.},

	Abstract = {Previous contributions to both the research and open source software
	communities detailed a generalization of a fast scalar field fitting
	technique for cubic B-splines based on the work originally proposed
	by Lee . One advantage of our proposed generalized B-spline fitting
	approach is its immediate application to a class of nonrigid registration
	techniques frequently employed in medical image analysis. Specifically,
	these registration techniques fall under the rubric of free-form
	deformation (FFD) approaches in which the object to be registered
	is embedded within a B-spline object. The deformation of the B-spline
	object describes the transformation of the image registration solution.
	Representative of this class of techniques, and often cited within
	the relevant community, is the formulation of Rueckert who employed
	cubic splines with normalized mutual information to study breast
	deformation. Similar techniques from various groups provided incremental
	novelty in the form of disparate explicit regularization terms, as
	well as the employment of various image metrics and tailored optimization
	methods. For several algorithms, the underlying gradient-based optimization
	retained the essential characteristics of Rueckert's original contribution.
	The contribution which we provide in this paper is two-fold: 1) the
	observation that the generic FFD framework is intrinsically susceptible
	to problematic energy topographies and 2) that the standard gradient
	used in FFD image registration can be modified to a well-understood
	preconditioned form which substantially improves performance. This
	is demonstrated with theoretical discussion and comparative evaluation
	experimentation.},

	Abstract = {PURPOSE: To propose and test the feasibility of a novel method for
	quantifying 3D regional pulmonary kinematics from hyperpolarized
	helium-3 tagged MRI in human subjects using a tailored image processing
	pipeline and a recently developed nonrigid registration framework.
	MATERIALS AND METHODS: Following image acquisition, inspiratory and
	expiratory tagged (3)He magnetic resonance (MR) images were preprocessed
	using various image filtering techniques to enhance the tag surfaces.
	Segmentation of the three orthogonal sets of tag planes in each lung
	produced distinct point-set representations of the tag surfaces.
	Using these labeled point-sets, deformation fields and corresponding
	strain maps were obtained via nonrigid point-set registration. Kinematic
	analysis was performed on three volunteers. RESULTS: Tag lines in
	inspiratory and expiratory images were coregistered producing a continuous
	3D correspondence mapping. Average displacement and directional strains
	were calculated in three subjects in the inferior, mid, and superior
	portions of the right and left lungs. As expected, the predominant
	direction of displacements with expiration is from inferior to superior.
	CONCLUSION: Kinematic quantitation of pulmonary motion using tagged
	(3)He MRI is feasible using the applied image preprocessing filtering
	techniques and nonrigid point-set registration. Potential benefits
	from regional pulmonary kinematic quantitation include the facilitation
	of diagnosis and local assessment of disease progression.},

	Abstract = {We present and evaluate a new method for automatically labeling the subfields of the hippocampal formation in focal 0.4 × 0.5 × 2.0mm(3) resolution T2-weighted magnetic resonance images that can be acquired in the routine clinical setting with under 5 min scan time. The method combines multi-atlas segmentation, similarity-weighted voting, and a novel learning-based bias correction technique to achieve excellent agreement with manual segmentation. Initial partitioning of MRI slices into hippocampal 'head', 'body' and 'tail' slices is the only input required from the user, necessitated by the nature of the underlying segmentation protocol. Dice overlap between manual and automatic segmentation is above 0.87 for the larger subfields, CA1 and dentate gyrus, and is competitive with the best results for whole-hippocampus segmentation in the literature. Intraclass correlation of volume measurements in CA1 and dentate gyrus is above 0.89. Overlap in smaller hippocampal subfields is lower in magnitude (0.54 for CA2, 0.62 for CA3, 0.77 for subiculum and 0.79 for entorhinal cortex) but comparable to overlap between manual segmentations by trained human raters. These results support the feasibility of subfield-specific hippocampal morphometry in clinical studies of memory and neurodegenerative disease.},

	Abstract = {One of the most challenging problems in modern neuroimaging is detailed characterization of neurodegeneration. Quantifying spatial and longitudinal atrophy patterns is an important component of this process. These spatiotemporal signals will aid in discriminating between related diseases, such as frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), which manifest themselves in the same at-risk population. Here, we develop a novel symmetric image normalization method (SyN) for maximizing the cross-correlation within the space of diffeomorphic maps and provide the Euler-Lagrange equations necessary for this optimization. We then turn to a careful evaluation of our method. Our evaluation uses gold standard, human cortical segmentation to contrast SyN's performance with a related elastic method and with the standard ITK implementation of Thirion's Demons algorithm. The new method compares favorably with both approaches, in particular when the distance between the template brain and the target brain is large. We then report the correlation of volumes gained by algorithmic cortical labelings of FTD and control subjects with those gained by the manual rater. This comparison shows that, of the three methods tested, SyN's volume measurements are the most strongly correlated with volume measurements gained by expert labeling. This study indicates that SyN, with cross-correlation, is a reliable method for normalizing and making anatomical measurements in volumetric MRI of patients and at-risk elderly individuals.},

	Abstract = {The goal of this research is to promote variational methods for anatomical averaging that operate within the space of the underlying image registration problem. This approach is effective when using the large deformation viscous framework, where linear averaging is not valid, or in the elastic case. The theory behind this novel atlas building algorithm is similar to the traditional pairwise registration problem, but with single image forces replaced by average forces. These group forces drive an average transport ordinary differential equation allowing one to estimate the geodesic that moves an image toward the mean shape configuration. This model gives large deformation atlases that are optimal with respect to the shape manifold as defined by the data and the image registration assumptions. We use the techniques in the large deformation context here, but they also pertain to small deformation atlas construction. Furthermore, a natural, inherently inverse consistent image registration is gained for free, as is a tool for constant arc length geodesic shape interpolation. The geodesic atlas creation algorithm is quantitatively compared to the Euclidean anatomical average to elucidate the need for optimized atlases. The procedures generate improved average representations of highly variable anatomy from distinct populations.},

@article{Wang:2012aa,
	Abstract = {Multi-atlas segmentation is an effective approach for automatically labeling objects of interest in biomedical images. In this approach, multiple expert-segmented example images, called \emph{atlases}, are registered to a target image, and deformed atlas segmentations are combined using \emph{label fusion}. Among the proposed label fusion strategies, weighted voting with spatially varying weight distributions derived from atlas-target intensity similarity have been particularly successful. However, one limitation of these strategies is that the weights are computed independently for each atlas, without taking into account the fact that different atlases may produce similar label errors. To address this limitation, we propose a new solution for the label fusion problem, in which weighted voting is formulated in terms of minimizing the total expectation of labeling error, and in which pairwise dependency between atlases is explicitly modeled as the joint probability of two atlases making a segmentation error at a voxel. This probability is approximated using intensity similarity between a pair of atlases and the target image in the neighborhood of each voxel. We validate our method in two medical image segmentation problems: hippocampus segmentation and hippocampus subfield segmentation in magnetic resonance (MR) images. For both problems, we show consistent and significant improvement over label fusion strategies that assign atlas weights independently.},

	Abstract = {Label fusion based multi-atlas segmentation has proven to be one of the most competitive techniques for medical image segmentation. This technique transfers segmentations from expert-labeled images, called atlases, to a novel image using deformable image registration. Errors produced by label transfer are further reduced by label fusion that combines the results produced by all atlases into a consensus solution. Among the proposed label fusion strategies, weighted voting with spatially varying weight distributions derived from atlas-target intensity similarity is a simple and highly effective label fusion technique. However, one limitation of most weighted voting methods is that the weights are computed independently for each atlas, without taking into account the fact that different atlases may produce similar label errors. To address this problem, we recently developed the joint label fusion technique and the corrective learning technique, which won the first place of the 2012 MICCAI Multi-Atlas Labeling Challenge and was one of the top performers in 2013 MICCAI Segmentation: Algorithms, Theory and Applications (SATA) challenge. To make our techniques more accessible to the scientific research community, we describe an Insight-Toolkit based open source implementation of our label fusion methods. Our implementation extends our methods to work with multi-modality imaging data and is more suitable for segmentation problems with multiple labels. We demonstrate the usage of our tools through applying them to the 2012 MICCAI Multi-Atlas Labeling Challenge brain image dataset and the 2013 SATA challenge canine leg image dataset. We report the best results on these two datasets so far.},

	Abstract = {We evaluate the impact of template choice on template-based segmentation of the hippocampus in epilepsy. Four dataset-specific strategies are quantitatively contrasted: the "closest to average" individual template, the average shape version of the closest to average template, a best appearance template and the best appearance and shape template proposed here and implemented in the open source toolkit Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTS). The cross-correlation similarity metric drives the correspondence model and is used consistently to determine the optimal appearance. Minimum shape distance in the diffeomorphic space determines optimal shape. Our evaluation results show that, with respect to gold-standard manual labeling of hippocampi in epilepsy, optimal shape and appearance template construction outperforms the other strategies for gaining data-derived templates. Our results also show the improvement is most significant on the diseased side and insignificant on the healthy side. Thus, the importance of the template increases when used to study pathology and may be less critical for normal control studies. Furthermore, explicit geometric optimization of the shape component of the unbiased template positively impacts the study of diseased hippocampi.},

	Abstract = {Publicly available scientific resources help establish evaluation standards, provide a platform for teaching and improve reproducibility. Version 4 of the Insight ToolKit (ITK(4)) seeks to establish new standards in publicly available image registration methodology. ITK(4) makes several advances in comparison to previous versions of ITK. ITK(4) supports both multivariate images and objective functions; it also unifies high-dimensional (deformation field) and low-dimensional (affine) transformations with metrics that are reusable across transform types and with composite transforms that allow arbitrary series of geometric mappings to be chained together seamlessly. Metrics and optimizers take advantage of multi-core resources, when available. Furthermore, ITK(4) reduces the parameter optimization burden via principled heuristics that automatically set scaling across disparate parameter types (rotations vs. translations). A related approach also constrains steps sizes for gradient-based optimizers. The result is that tuning for different metrics and/or image pairs is rarely necessary allowing the researcher to more easily focus on design/comparison of registration strategies. In total, the ITK(4) contribution is intended as a structure to support reproducible research practices, will provide a more extensive foundation against which to evaluate new work in image registration and also enable application level programmers a broad suite of tools on which to build. Finally, we contextualize this work with a reference registration evaluation study with application to pediatric brain labeling.},

	Abstract = {The United States National Institutes of Health (NIH) commit significant support to open-source data and software resources in order to foment reproducibility in the biomedical imaging sciences. Here, we report and evaluate a recent product of this commitment: Advanced Neuroimaging Tools (ANTs), which is approaching its 2.0 release. The ANTs open source software library consists of a suite of state-of-the-art image registration, segmentation and template building tools for quantitative morphometric analysis. In this work, we use ANTs to quantify, for the first time, the impact of similarity metrics on the affine and deformable components of a template-based normalization study. We detail the ANTs implementation of three similarity metrics: squared intensity difference, a new and faster cross-correlation, and voxel-wise mutual information. We then use two-fold cross-validation to compare their performance on openly available, manually labeled, T1-weighted MRI brain image data of 40 subjects (UCLA's LPBA40 dataset). We report evaluation results on cortical and whole brain labels for both the affine and deformable components of the registration. Results indicate that the best ANTs methods are competitive with existing brain extraction results (Jaccard=0.958) and cortical labeling approaches. Mutual information affine mapping combined with cross-correlation diffeomorphic mapping gave the best cortical labeling results (Jaccard=0.669$\pm$0.022). Furthermore, our two-fold cross-validation allows us to quantify the similarity of templates derived from different subgroups. Our open code, data and evaluation scripts set performance benchmark parameters for this state-of-the-art toolkit. This is the first study to use a consistent transformation framework to provide a reproducible evaluation of the isolated effect of the similarity metric on optimal template construction and brain labeling.},

	Abstract = {We introduce Atropos, an ITK-based multivariate n-class open source segmentation algorithm distributed with ANTs ( http://www.picsl.upenn.edu/ANTs). The Bayesian formulation of the segmentation problem is solved using the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm with the modeling of the class intensities based on either parametric or non-parametric finite mixtures. Atropos is capable of incorporating spatial prior probability maps (sparse), prior label maps and/or Markov Random Field (MRF) modeling. Atropos has also been efficiently implemented to handle large quantities of possible labelings (in the experimental section, we use up to 69 classes) with a minimal memory footprint. This work describes the technical and implementation aspects of Atropos and evaluates its performance on two different ground-truth datasets. First, we use the BrainWeb dataset from Montreal Neurological Institute to evaluate three-tissue segmentation performance via (1) K-means segmentation without use of template data; (2) MRF segmentation with initialization by prior probability maps derived from a group template; (3) Prior-based segmentation with use of spatial prior probability maps derived from a group template. We also evaluate Atropos performance by using spatial priors to drive a 69-class EM segmentation problem derived from the Hammers atlas from University College London. These evaluation studies, combined with illustrative examples that exercise Atropos options, demonstrate both performance and wide applicability of this new platform-independent open source segmentation tool.},
